.. important:: This is a prerelease of the Integrated Methane Inversion Workflow user guide.
   These pages are the most up-to-date and accurate instructions for the IMI Workflow, but they
   are still a work in progress. 
   
   Contributions (e.g., suggestions, edits, revisions) would be greatly appreciated. See
   :ref:`editing this guide <editing_this_user_guide>` and our :doc:`contributing guidelines <reference/CONTRIBUTING>`. 
   If you find something hard to understand---let us know!

The Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) workflow is a cloud-based (or local cluster) tool for quantifying methane emissions by inversion of satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The IMI uses `GEOS-Chem <http://geos-chem.org>`_ as forward model for the inversion and infers methane emissions at 25 Ã— 25 km\ :sup:`2`\  resolution.

This site provides instructions for setting up and running the IMI. Some instructions are specific to the AWS cloud, but most steps in the workflow do not require a cloud environment. 

We explain how to launch an EC2 instance from our custom AMI, configure and run an inversion, and analyze results with a ready-made jupyter notebook.
