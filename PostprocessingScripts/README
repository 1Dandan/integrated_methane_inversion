inversion.py:		Contains an Inversion class (and several inherited 
		        subclasses) for solving and plotting analytic 
			inversion results. The inherited classes allow for
		        reduced rank inversion solution as detailed in 
			Bousserez and Henze (2017) and for reduced rank
		        Jacobian construction. The most recent Inversion 
			class can be found along with other scripts relevant
			to the reduced rank demonstration case at 
			https://github.com/hannahnesser/reduced_rank_jacobian/
			Please feel free to create your own fork and create 
			pull requests for any desired changes! (And I will 
                        update the copy here on a regular basis.)
