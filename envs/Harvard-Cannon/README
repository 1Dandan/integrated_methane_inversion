Overview:

In this directory we provide sample environment files.

   (1) gcc.gfortran10.2_cannon.env - File for loading modules and setting environment
                                     variables for compiling and running GEOS-Chem.
				     This loads the GCC 10.2 open-source compiler.

   (2) gcc.ifort19_cannon.env      - File for loading modules and setting environment
                                     variables for compiling and running GEOS-Chem.
				     This loads the IFORT 19 proprietary compiler.

   (3) ch4_inv.yml                 - File for creating a Conda environment in python
                                     that loads the packages needed to execute the
				     scripts in the CH4_TROPOMI_INV repository.
