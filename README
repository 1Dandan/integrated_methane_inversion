README -- Describes the contents of /n/seasasfs02/CH4_Inversion
20 Feb 2020

Overview:
===============================================================================

This directory contains the GEOS-Chem source code, run directories, input
data files, preprocessing, and post-processing scripts used to run CH4
analytical inversions. This is a shared space meant to unify the CH4
inversion workflow among Jacob Group members.

Feel free to contribute to this directory, but we ask that you document your
additions in the Revision History section of this README file below. If
you provide new data files, please include a README file within the directory
that those files are stored with details about the contents, references, and
how the files were created (including scripts when possible).

Contents:
===============================================================================

Code.CH4_Inv
------------
   GEOS-Chem source code containing updates for running analytical inversions
   of methane. These updates are stored in the 'CH4_Analytical_Inversion' branch
   (navigate to the code directory and type 'gitk --all' to view the
   complete revision history).

InputData/ClusterFiles
----------------------
   Contains cluster files used in previous studies to perturb emissions for
   analytical inversions. Where possible, the scripts used to create those
   cluster files are provided.

InputData/HEMCO
---------------
   Contains CH4 emission files (in the CH4/ subdirectory) that are commonly
   used in the methane inversions, but may not necessarily be included in the
   standard GEOS-Chem methane simulation.

InputData/Posterior
-------------------
   Contains scale factor files from previous analytical inversions. Directories
   are named for the lead author and in cases where an author has more than
   one set of scale factor files, the files are separated into subdirectories
   by date.

InputData/Restarts
------------------
   Contains restart files used to initialize methane simulations. See the README
   in that directory for details on how each restart file was generated.

PostprocessingScripts
---------------------
   Includes any scripts used to postprocess files used to construct the
   Jacobian, compare GEOS-Chem output to satellites, etc.
			    
PreprocessingScripts
--------------------
   Includes any scripts needed to preprocess files used in methane analytical
   inversions.

RunDirScripts
-------------
   Contains scripts used to set up CH4 analytical inversion run directories, to
   submit the runs, and to check that the runs finished successfully. See
   'RunDirSetupInstructions' for detailed steps on setting up your run
   directories.

UnitTester.CH4_Inv
------------------
   GEOS-Chem unit tester containing run directory updates for running
   analytical inversions of methane. These updates are stored in the
   'CH4_Analytical_Inversion' branch (navigate to the code directory and
   type 'gitk --all' to view the complete revision history).
