README -- Describes the contents of /n/seasasfs02/CH4_Inversion
20 Feb 2020

Overview:
===============================================================================

This directory contains the GEOS-Chem source code and post-processing scripts
used to run CH4 analytical inversions.

Contents:
===============================================================================

GEOS-Chem
------------
   GEOS-Chem source code containing updates for running analytical inversions
   of methane. These updates are stored in the 'CH4_Analytical_Inversion' branch
   (navigate to the code directory and type 'gitk --all' to view the
   complete revision history).

   This directory is a Git submodule within the UMI_workflow repository.
   

PostprocessingScripts
---------------------
   Includes any scripts used to postprocess files used to construct the
   Jacobian, compare GEOS-Chem output to satellites, etc.
			    

Revision History:
===============================================================================

20 Feb 2020 - M. Sulprizio - Initial setup using latest updates from J.D.
                             Maasakkers et al. (2019) and Y. Zhang et al. (2020)

27 May 2020 - H. Nesser    - Added two scripts to PostprocessingScripts:
       	      	 	     inversion.py: contains an Inversion class (and
			     several inherited subclasses) for solving and
			     plotting analytic inversion results. 
		           - format_plots.py: needed for the plots in the
			     Inversion class.
			   - These scripts and others for post-processing
			     (though with fewer comments) can be found on 
			      https://github.com/hannahnesser/reduced_rank_jacobian/
			     Please feel free to create your own fork and create
 			     pull requests for any desired changes! (And I will 
                             update these copies on a regular basis.)

13 Dec 2020 - M. Sulprizio - Made GEOS-Chem source code a Git submodule and
                             move run directory files there instead of relying
			     on the soon-to-be obsolete unit tester.
			   - Added a Git submodule for CH4_TROPOMI_INV,
			     containing inversion  scripts.
			   - Cleaned up setup_ch4_runs.sh and added option to
			     create a spinup run directory.
			   - Added run_inversion.sh script modified from Daniel
			     Varon's inversion_script.sh.
